### Admonitions

Admonitions are mapped from Notion's _callout_, the emoji in the callout defines the type of admonition.

#### Admonition Types

‚ÄºÔ∏è = attention  
‚ö†Ô∏è = caution, warning  
üî• = danger  
‚ùå = error  
üí° = hint, tip  
‚ÑπÔ∏è = important  

#### Admonition Titles

If the first line is enclosed in quotes, it will become the title of the admonition:
Example: `‚ÄúThis is very Important‚Äù`
